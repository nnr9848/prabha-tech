# Project Instructions & Agent Guidelines

## Interaction & Decision Standards
1. **Always Answer and Clarify First**: When asked any question, provide a clear explanation, trade-offs, and your proposed recommendation first.
2. **Obtain Explicit Permission**: **DO NOT** execute or implement code/system changes straight away upon answering a question. Always wait for explicit user approval before modifying files or running commands.
3. **Keep User in Full Control**: Outline what will change, why, and how before proceeding with any implementation.
4. **Industry Standard Solutions Only**: Always suggest and apply robust, production-grade, industry-standard practices. **Never** propose or use temporary hacks, quick workarounds, or fragile patches at any time.
5. **Always Prefer Best UX**: Prioritize state-of-the-art UX/UI principles, high visual comfort, accessibility, intuitive user flows, and polished micro-interactions across all platforms and form factors.
6. **Centralized Reusable Architecture & Zero Hardcoding**: Always utilize centralized design system tokens (`var(--...)`), global theme classes, and modular reusable components wherever possible. **Never** hardcode ad-hoc inline styles, raw hex colors, duplicated component logic, or magic constants as per modern software engineering standards.
7. **Server-Side Ground-Truth & Zero-Trust Security (Defense-in-Depth)**: All security constraints, RBAC boundaries, state validations, and business logic guardrails (e.g. self-deactivation prevention, last-admin lockout prevention, data tenancy) **MUST ALWAYS** be enforced strictly on the backend server (Spring Boot REST layer / Database constraints). Frontend validation is strictly an ergonomic UX helper and must never be relied upon as a security barrier.
8. **API-First & Mobile App Parity Architecture**: Build every feature as a clean, decoupled REST API endpoint. Ensure data payloads, validation error messages, status codes (200, 201, 400, 403, 409), and pagination are fully standardized to support web, iOS, and Android clients (e.g. Flutter / React Native) with zero backend rework.
9. **Production-Grade Engineering Over Hacks**: Never introduce temporary shortcuts, monkey patches, or brittle mocks. All migrations must use standard Flyway SQL scripts, all entity state changes must be auditable, and all components must adhere to enterprise production quality.
